">>>" called as Python Prompt

Language: Language is a communication media.

Python Character
	1. Numbers 0 - 9
	2. String a-ZA-Z
	3. Special Symbols !@#$%^...

Python Keywords: Reserved Words intended to do specific task (only30)
		help('keywords')
Python Statements: Statements are instructions represented as expressions. 
			Two Types	1. Simple Statement
					2. Compound Statement

Variables : Reserved memory locations which are intended to store some value in it.
		a) Implicit : Implicit variables are those which are defined and used. The type specification is understood by the system based on the value associated to it.
			a=10, b='wipro'
		b) Explicit : are those which are decalred, defined and used. The type specification is understood by the system based on programmer declaration.
Most of scriipting langague they go with Implicit variables
Most of the hight level lang -  explicit

Data Type - Provides type specification for the reserved memory location.

In python we call variables as Labels
a=10 (Read as - a references to 10)

Type #Displays type of label
id() #Returns numeric address of the given reference

#Comment - Descriptive statements
		1. Program Comments / Script Comments - Starting of Code - Overview of code
			a. Title of the Program
			b. Author of the Program
			c. Version of the Program
			d. Date and Time of the Program
			e. Desciription/Summary - 5 to 10 lines max
		2. Code Comments

Print Styles - 3 Types

__main__ : Named Space - Declarative region - Called as under under main under main

C Program
#include<stdio.h> #Preprocess_Statements
int main() {	#__main__
}

int main: #Give : to define new block
	print("a")
return 0

Control Statements: Controls the flow of execution
Two types:	a. Conditonal Control Statements - if
		b. Loop Control Statements - while and for
For loops mostly for Data Structure
While loops for generic

Data Structure: DS is a mechanism to provide layout for data storage and retrival which is easier and faster

Array : It is simplest data structure which is used to stroe multiple values under a single identifier
Properties:	1. Homogeneous
		2. Sequential
		3. Static with size


DS in Python : List, Tuple, Dictionary

List: Core DS in Python which is ordered and mutable having dynamic and extensible memory allocation with hetrogeneous storage type.
Ordered - Insertion order is preserved
Extensible - Grow or Shrink memory size

List elements are access using index from 0 to n-1 where n is the length of list.

label=[val1, val2,..., val n]
In Python - Everything is at RUntime
