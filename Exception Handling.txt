What is it, why is it n how it is?

Errors are events which are triggered during the execution of the program which are unexcepted and abnoraml by nature

Exceptions are mechanism to deal with errors

Errors are categorized to three type

	a)Runtime Errors
	b)Complie Error
	c)Logical Errors

Compile time errors are those which are triggered during the compilation of the program.
Error occured due to Bad Syntax
How to fix - Know the language correctly..

Run time - Triggered during the exection of program..
How to fix - defining test cases

Logical Errors - Errors are triggered during execution of the prgram which is not seens and hidden..
Triggered due to Bad lOgic / incorrect

Logical errors are fixed by defining appropirate use cases (Funcitonal Testing)

In python we deal with run time errors using exception handlers

THe follwoing are the guidelines for the exception handling

Define only those exceptions which are possible / tentative in the program..
Define most likely exception at the top and less likely exception at the bottom..
Define the exception object to handle the default message..
Define non technical and simple english message for error description
Define default exceptions at the end, to handle all the undefined exceptions..
Define exceptions are nesed to group better... or to provide code clarity...
Define common type of exception as group
Define the program closure statements along with exception handler to take to program closure requirements

Python defines try n except block to deal with exceptions.
